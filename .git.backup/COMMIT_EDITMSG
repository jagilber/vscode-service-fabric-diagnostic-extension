perf: silence repeated image store checks during auto-refresh

- Only log on first check (cache miss), silent on cache hits
- Auto-refresh runs every 30s and recreates tree
- With caching, subsequent checks are instant and silent
- Reduces log noise from '...image store connection string...' every 30s
- Makes cache benefit more obvious

Before: Logs every auto-refresh cycle
After: Logs once per cluster connect/refresh
